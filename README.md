* [Please see ticket #8 for more information](https://github.com/Neo-Desktop/WindowsXPKg/issues/8)

### **FAQ**

#### **What does it do?**

* This program allows you to generate endless Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 keys.
  You also can use it to check your already existing keys.

#### **How does it work?**

* [Enderman's XPKeygen Readme explains everything in detail.](https://github.com/Endermanch/XPKeygen)

#### **How do I use it?**

* It all comes down to four simple steps:


### **Usage**
1. *(GitHub account required)* Download the latest version through the Actions tab ([Windows](https://github.com/Neo-Desktop/WindowsXPKg/actions/workflows/windows.yml), [Linux](https://github.com/Neo-Desktop/WindowsXPKg/actions/workflows/linux.yml)). Make sure you have both xpkey(.exe), keys.json and libcrypto.so (Linux)/libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll (Windows), then run `./xpkey` to generate a key, or add `--help` to see more options.

2. *(For retail and OEM only)* After installation, you will be prompted to activate Windows. Select the *telephone activation* method, then, run `./xpkey -i <Installation ID>` using the installation ID that the activation wizard gave you.

3. Click "**Next**"

4. Profit!
